# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to cobine data regarding the schools, students, scores and budget. Through varios equations and syntax formats, the average scores for different schools and grade levels were inspected and manipulated in this case. 
### Deliverable 1 Purpose:
##### The purpose of this part of the assignment was to replace the ninth grade math and reading score data with NAN oonly for a single highschool. This would impact the data and as we dive deeper we are able to get a better veiw of the affect the impact of changing that data has on the rest of the datasets.
### Deliverable 2 Purpose:
##### This part of the assignment allows us to see the impact of the first deliverable on the school district level and allows us to compare ther schools data to the high school with replacement data.
